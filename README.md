## 🚀 Getting Started

No build tools or dependencies required. This is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MrMustSeeUs/TanitiPrototype.git

# 2. Navigate into the project folder
cd TanitiPrototype

# 3. Open in your browser
# Option A — just double-click index.html in your file explorer
# Option B — use a local dev server for best results (no CORS issues)
npx serve .
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Using `npx serve .` gives you a local server at `http://localhost:3000`
> and avoids browser security restrictions that can block local file access.

## 🔒 Security

This project follows OWASP best practices for front-end security:

- No API keys or secrets stored in the codebase
- User input is sanitized before DOM insertion
- Security headers enforced at the CDN layer — CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning via Dependabot — _coming Sprint 4_
