                                <p>Visitors from most countries do not need a visa for stays under 90 days. However, you
                                    will need a valid passport with at least six months validity beyond your planned
                                    departure date. Please check with your country's travel authority or the Taniti
                                    Tourism Board for specific requirements based on your nationality.</p>

                                <p>Taniti enjoys a tropical climate year-round with temperatures ranging from 75°F to
                                    90°F (24°C to 32°C). The dry season from April to October is generally considered
                                    the best time to visit, with less rainfall and humidity. The peak tourist season is
                                    from June to August.</p>
                                <p>The rainy season from November to March brings occasional heavy showers, but they
                                    typically pass quickly. This period offers fewer crowds and lower prices, making it
                                    attractive for budget travelers.</p>

                                <p>The official currency is the Taniti Dollar (TND), but US dollars are widely accepted
                                    throughout the island. Major credit cards are accepted at hotels, larger
                                    restaurants, and tour operators, but it's advisable to carry cash for smaller
                                    establishments and markets.</p>
                                <p>ATMs are available in the main town and at the airport. We recommend exchanging some

                                <p>No specific vaccinations are required to enter Taniti, but we recommend being
                                    up-to-date on routine vaccinations. The CDC and WHO recommend hepatitis A and

                                <p>Taniti has good quality drinking water in most tourist areas, but bottled water is
                                    widely available if preferred. The island has a modern hospital in the main town and
                                    several clinics throughout the island.</p>
                                <p>We recommend purchasing travel insurance that includes medical coverage before your

                                <p>Traditional Tanitian cuisine is a flavorful blend of Pacific Island, Asian, and
                                    European influences, featuring fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and locally grown
                                    vegetables. Key elements include:</p>

                                        marinated in citrus juices (similar to ceviche), grilled octopus, and coconut

                                    <li><strong>Tropical Fruits</strong>: Papaya, mango, pineapple, and lesser-known
                                        local fruits feature in both savory dishes and desserts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Coconut</strong>: Used in nearly every form—the milk, cream, flesh, and
                                        oil are all common ingredients.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Spices</strong>: Ginger, chili, lemongrass, and vanilla are prominent

                                    <li><strong>Palusami</strong>: Taro leaves wrapped around coconut cream and onions,

                            <h3>Can the island accommodate dietary restrictions?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Yes, most restaurants on Taniti can accommodate common dietary restrictions, though
                                    the level of understanding and options vary by establishment:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Vegetarian</strong>: Well-understood and catered for at most
                                        restaurants, with many traditional dishes naturally vegetarian.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Vegan</strong>: Increasingly accommodated, especially at higher-end
                                        restaurants and those in tourist areas. Traditional cuisine uses coconut milk
                                        rather than dairy in many dishes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gluten-Free</strong>: Understood at larger restaurants and resorts.
                                        Traditional cuisine is largely gluten-free, using taro, sweet potato, and rice
                                        instead of wheat.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Food Allergies</strong>: Major allergies are taken seriously at resorts
                                        and upscale restaurants. Always communicate your specific needs clearly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Religious Dietary Restrictions</strong>: Halal options are limited but
                                        available at some restaurants. Kosher meals generally require special
                                        arrangements.</li>

                                    <li>Research and contact restaurants in advance when possible</li>
                                    <li>Learn relevant phrases in Tanitian or carry a dietary card in the local language

                                    <li>Inform your hotel of your needs; they can often make recommendations</li>

                                <p>Tap water is generally safe to drink in the main town and at major resorts, which
                                    have modern water treatment facilities. However, in more remote areas of the island,

                                    <li>Confirming with your accommodation about local water safety</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding ice in remote areas unless you're certain it's made from purified water

                                <p>If you're staying for an extended period or visiting remote areas, consider bringing
                                    a portable water filter or purification tablets to reduce plastic waste from bottled

                                <p>Tipping is not traditionally part of Tanitian culture, but it has become more common
                                    in tourist areas. Here's a general guide:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Restaurants</strong>: A 10% service charge is often included at
                                        higher-end establishments. If not included, a 10-15% tip for good service is
                                        appreciated but not expected.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hotels</strong>: $1-2 USD per bag for porters, $2-5 USD per day for
                                        housekeeping left in the room daily.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tour Guides</strong>: 10-15% of the tour cost for a full-day tour with
                                        excellent service.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Taxis</strong>: Rounding up the fare or adding 10% is appreciated but
                                        not mandatory.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Spas</strong>: 15-20% for treatments if a service charge is not already
                                        included.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Always check your bill to see if a service charge has already been added. Tipping in
                                    local currency is preferred, but US dollars are widely accepted.</p>
                                <p>In more rural areas and at local establishments, tipping is less common and not
                                    expected, though always appreciated for exceptional service.</p>

                                <p>Respecting local customs will enhance your experience on Taniti. Here are important
                                    etiquette guidelines:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Greetings</strong>: A handshake is common, though some Tanitians may
                                        place their hand over their heart after shaking hands as a sign of respect.
                                        Learning simple greetings in the local language is appreciated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dress Code</strong>: Modest dress is appropriate when visiting villages,
                                        religious sites, and local communities. Cover shoulders and knees, and remove
                                        shoes when entering someone's home or a temple.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Photography</strong>: Always ask permission before photographing locals,
                                        especially during ceremonies or in villages. Some sacred sites prohibit
                                        photography.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Religious Respect</strong>: Remove hats and shoes when entering
                                        religious buildings. Speak quietly and avoid pointing at religious objects or
                                        images.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Body Language</strong>: Pointing with your finger is considered rude;
                                        use your whole hand or chin instead. Avoid touching someone's head, which is
                                        considered sacred.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gifts</strong>: If invited to a local's home, bringing a small gift is
                                        appreciated. Fruit, sweets, or items from your home country are appropriate.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Environment</strong>: Respect for nature is deeply ingrained in Tanitian
                                        culture. Never litter, damage coral reefs, or disturb wildlife.</li>
